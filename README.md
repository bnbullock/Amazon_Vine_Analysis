# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Project Overview

We have been tasked by a client with analysing differnet Amazon reviews that have been written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. This service allows manufactures and publishers to receive reviews for their products directly from Amazon Vine members. The clients pay a fee to Amazon and provide products directly to Amazon Vine members who are then required to publish a related product review.

Amazon has provided access to approximately 50 different datasets, each one contains specific reviews for specific product categories. We are asked to  select a dataset specifically relevant to our client which contains reviews and feedback specific to one of their products. Once we have selected the client-spefic dataset, we will use PySpark to perform the ETL process to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin. Secondly, we have the choice of using PySpark, Pandas, or SQL to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in the dataset. In our case, we will be using PySpark for this section of the data analysis and then annotating a summary of the results for our client to review along with their stakeholders.

- Deliverables:
  1. Peform an ETL function using Amazon AWS, Google Colab Notebooks and pgAdmin.
  2. Calculate matrics to determine if a paid Vine review make a difference in the percentage of 5-star reviews.

## Overall Summary

For this part of the Challenge, youâ€™ll write a report that summarizes the analysis you performed in Deliverable 2.

The report should contain the following:

Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions:

How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
Summary: In your summary, state if there is any positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. Use 
the results of your analysis to support your statement. Then, provide one additional analysis that you 
could do with the dataset to support your statement.
